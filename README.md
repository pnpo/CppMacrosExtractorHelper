# Introduction 
CppMacrosHelper is a small tool to extract macros information from c/c++ configuration files (makefiles, .cmake or compilation database files) or else from specific .h libraries files.
It will generate a json file that contains all the macros found.

As an extra, it also extracts (from the configuration files) paths to folders where the compilers will get include libs.
